        <h1><u>When</u></h1>
        <h3>The old kingdom was estimated to be around 3,077 years old or around 2575 BCE<br>(“Ancient Egypt - The Old Kingdom”)<h3>
        <h1><u>Where</u></h1>
        <h3>The old kingdom was known to have developed along the the Nile River <br> (“Ancient Egypt - The Old Kingdom”)
        </h3>
        <h1><u>Why</u></h1>
        <h3>The annual flooding of the Nile was providing a really good soil that was heavily used <br> in
        ancient Egypt for agriculture. This really helps them stay stable and not go around every year(Boyer)</h3>
