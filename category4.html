        <h4>(“Amenemhet I”)</h4>

        <p>The old kingdom of egypt had one of the most important centers in Nubia which was a big territory that was located in the south of Egypt, besides the Nile,
            <br>This was estimated to have happened 2613-1782 BCE (More then 800 years).  
         The Egyptian was calling it Yam, it was described as a resource for ivory gold, and wood. <br>
